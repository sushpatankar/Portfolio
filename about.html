                <p>
                    <p> My name is Sushant. I love writing code and solving problems using AI. 
                        My interest in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science carried me from 
                        Pune, India to Fort Collins, Colorado to attend graduate school at Colorado 
                        State University. 
                        As a graduate student, my masters project was based on Alternative splicing in the genomic data under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~asa/">Dr. 
                        Asa Ben-Hur</a>.
                        
                    <p>
                        As a grad student at Colorado State University, my coursework was mainly focused in the 
                        area of Software Development, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science. 
                        In the field of AI, I have worked in natural language processing, bioinformatics, 
                        and image computation. As a data science intern at JBS USA, I build an object detection 
                        model on a custom dataset using Tensorflow. Being a machine learning intern at C-DAC, 
                        I worked on a Neural Machine Translation using LSTM's and attention.
