                <p>
                <p> My name is Sushant. I love writing code and solving problems using AI.
                    My interest in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science carried me from
                    Pune, India to Fort Collins, Colorado to attend graduate school at Colorado
                    State University.
                    As a graduate student, my masters project was based on Alternative splicing in the genomic data
                    under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~asa/">Dr.
                        Asa Ben-Hur</a>.

                <p>
                    Being a grad student at Colorado State University, my coursework mainly focused on the area of
                    Software Development, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science.
                    During my internship as a data scientist at JBS USA, I build an object detection model on a custom
                    dataset using Tensorflow. As a machine learning intern at C-DAC,
                    I worked on a Neural Machine Translation using LSTM's and attention.
                </p>
